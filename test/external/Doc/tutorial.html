    <h2>
      Abstract
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document will briefly introduce one aspect of eXtreme
      Programming (XP) which we will use in our development cycle, the
      DUnit. It will describe how to Use Test Harnesses to test the
      code we have written and demonstrate its advantages in
      refactoring, optimizations, peace of mind and the quality of our
      software.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      DUnit orgininates from an eXtreme Programming module which tests
      the developers code and confirms that the code or module does
      what it should.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept is simple: write your test harness first and expect
      your code to fail before implementation. After implementation,
      ALL tests should pass. If you can think of different scenarios,
      write the test cases, testing for the correct results. And
      remember, when a bug is found, the developer will only test that
      bug once manually because he MUST write a test case to keep
      testing for that bug in the future.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
      SUnit, JUnit, CUnit, etc...
    </h3>
    <p>
      DUnit is a member of the *Unit family for all the different
      programming languages. It is developed as an Open Source project
      in sourceforge (<a href=
      "http://dunit.sourceforge.net/">dunit.sourceforge.net</a>) and
      can be freely downloaded and used.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Refactoring
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is also important that when we review (clean up ugly code,
      make things more readable) and optimize (make things faster) we
      do not break the software. If we have written complete test
      harnesses, then ALL tests should pass as before. This gives us a
      lot of opportunity to modify (for the better) existing code but
      ensuring that the process does not affect the end result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refactoring is this process of going back into old code,
      improving it, and ensuring that the results are the same if not
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is especially important for the case of OO Programming where
      changes in the Base class may have dire consequences to the
      inherited classes. So if we have tests written throughout the
      hierarchy, changes which change the behaviour of descendant
      classes can be detected.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Example Test Harness
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this Example, we will demonstrate how to
    </p>
    <p>
      1.create a simple class declaration without its implementation
    </p>
    <p>
      2.setup the test harness
    </p>
    <p>
      3.write its test cases
    </p>
    <p>
      4.run the test harness expecting errors because of the incomplete
      implementation
    </p>
    <p>
      5.implement each function one by one
    </p>
    <p>
      6.continuously test our creation iteratively
    </p>
    <p>
      The example is to create a simple Counting object called TCounter
      which takes in an input value and when functions like double,
      factorial, power are called, it will do the operation on the
      value and also return the values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the UML diagram which describes the classes inheritance,
      the attributes and functions we need to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <h4>
      For any Class, there must be another Class to test it.
    </h4>
    <p>
      For example, TCounter will have a TCounterTest, and this should
      exist in a seperate application from the actual usable app.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      Setting up the Project Test Harness
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here are the steps to create a Test Harness:
    </p>
    <p>
      1.Make a New project
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Remove Unit1 (the default Form unit) from the Project
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Add to the project these units: <b>GUITestRunner</b> and <b>
      TestFrameWork</b> which are located in crmpos/Tests/DUnit
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Replace Application.Initialize and Application.Run&nbsp; with
      GUITestRunner.runRegisteredTests
    </p>
    <p>
      5.Thats all you have to do, and the project code should look
      something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
 
uses
  CounterCls in 'CounterCls.pas',,
  CounterTest in 'CounterTest.pas',,
  TestFramework in '..\..\..\Tests\DUnit\TestFramework.pas',
  GUITestRunner in '..\..\..\Tests\DUnit\GUITestRunner.pas' {GUITestRunner};
 
{$R *.res}
 
begin
  
end.h
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      Making a new Unit Test
    </h2>
    <p>
      If we were to test the TCounter class, we will create a new unit
      and call it <b>CounterTest.pas</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In it, we must use <b>TestFrameWork</b> from DUnit. Of course we
      will also use the objects which we want to test which is
      CounterCls.pas
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
{   020607  yky  Created to illustrate the use of DUnitUnit
                   This unit will test the TCounter Class.he TCounter Class.
}
interface
uses
   , ;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Inheriting TTestCase
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is to create a Test Case Object, and to do
      so, we inherit from TTestCase.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will also then <b>override</b> two <b>protected</b> <b>
      procedures</b> called <b>SetUp</b> and <b>TearDown</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequent Tests will be <b>published procedures</b> which have
      names starting with '<b>test</b>'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code should look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
  TCounterTest = class(TTestCase))
  protectedd
       mCounter: TCounter;
    procedure SetUp; override;de;
    procedure TearDown; override;de;
  publishedd
    procedure testDouble;le;
       procedure testPower;
    procedure testFactorial;al;
  end;;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      SetUp
    </h3>
    <p>
      The SetUp function is called for every published test procedure
      in this Harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case we need a FObj instantiated every time.
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
begin
  inherited;;

end;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The FObj is usually the object we intend to test.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TearDown
    </h3>
    <p>
      For everything that has been Created, we will need to destroy. So
      TearDown would look something like this:
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
begin
  inherited;;

end;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have done our housekeeping, we are ready to test the
      hell out of mCounter!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Writing some tests
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before we write the tests, we have to look at the object we are
      testing and its specifications. We do not need to have the object
      implemented yet. Here is the object:
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
   publisheded
     property input: real;eal;
     property DoubleIt: real;eal;
     property PowerIt: real;eal;
     property FactorialIt: real;eal;
   end;d;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      This object is rather basic. Given and input, it can calculate
      the double with DoubleIt, the power of itself with PowerIt and
      the factorial with FactorialIt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know what our Class to be tested is suppose to do, we
      can proceed in writing the Test Harness before implementing it!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Publishing the testDouble
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is write a published procedure called
      testDouble. The Test Harness Class should look something like
      this:
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
  protectedd
    mCounter: TCounter;er;
    procedure SetUp; override;de;
    procedure TearDown; override;de;
  publishedd
       
    procedure testPower;er;
    procedure testFactorial;al;
    procedure testFactorialNegative;ve;
  end;;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Using Check
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Check</b> is a DUnit function which takes in two parameters;
      the first is the <b>logical</b> operation and the second is the
      <b>error</b> <b>message</b> or information to report if something
      did go wrong.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Test Plan for DoubleIt
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a test plan for DoubleIt
    </p>
    <p>
      1.Set the input to 5
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Check that DoubleIt is 10
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Check larger numbers of Doubleit
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Check Fractions of double it
    </p>
    <p>
      5.Check negative numbers of DoubleIt
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
begin
  with mCounter doo
  beginn
     input := 5;= 5;
     Check( input = 5, 'input should be 5');5');
     Check( DoubleIt = 10, 'double of 5 should be 10');0');
     input := 1055;055;
     Check( DoubleIt = 2110, 'double of 1055 should be 2110');0');
     input := 11.23;.23;
     Check( abs(DoubleIt - 22.46) &lt; 0.001,001,
                  'double should work for fractions ' + FloatToStr( DoubleIt ));Str( DoubleIt ));
     input := -23.43;.43;
     Check( abs(DoubleIt - (-46.86)) &lt; 0.001,001,
                  'double should work for negatives too'); negatives too');
  end;;
end;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      <i>We need to use the funny abs function &lt; 0.001 because
      floating point numbers do not equate well with fractions.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Testing Exceptions
    </h3>
    <p>
      There will definitely be cases where we purposely attempt to
      break the object by giving it invalid data: Exceptions would be
      raised during Validations or operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Counter Class code, we have defined factorial only able to
      accept positive numbers. Negative numbers will result in an
      exception being raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the Test Harness of the plan and code for
      testFactorialNegative:
    </p>
    <p>
      1.Set the input value to -5
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Attempt to get the Factorial Value
    </p>
    <p>
      3.If an exception was not raised, then report and error in the
      implementation
    </p>
    <p>
      4.If an exception called ECounterNegative was caught then the
      Counter class was constructed well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the code:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
begin
  with mCounter doo
  beginn
     input := -5; -5;
     try try
        Check( FactorialIt &gt; 0, 'Factorial it should raise an exception');tion');
        Check( False, 'This should never execute.');ute.');
     exceptcept
       on ECounterNegative do Check(True, 'Negative Factorial detected OK'); OK');
     end;end;
  end;;
end;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how we use the Check function. In this case, we do not use
      it to test anything, but hard code True and False values into it
      to send messages to the DUnit interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      We always must send a Check(False) if we do not want the
      execution to continue; where errors that have occurred yet no
      exceptions were raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Check(True) just to confirm to ourselves that the execution
      was correct.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Registering TTestCase
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once we have completed writing the test harness, we will have to
      register this so that the GUITestRunner can run the tests. To do
      so, add this in the initialization section of the Unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
   ('Tutorial/Counter', TCounterTest.Suite);
end.
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      In RegisterTest, the first parameter describes the Tree or
      Hierarchy in the placement of the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second parameter is the TTestCase object which you have just
      defined. The published test procedures will be displayed in the
      UI
    </p>
    <h2>
      Running the Test Harness
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just press F9 within Delphi, or run the compiled application
      directly, and the DUnit interface will appear. Just press the
      green Play button, and it will run through the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are any Check errors, a pink result will appear. Any
      uncaught exceptions will be represented by red colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything goes well, then all the tests should be green.

    <h3>
      Implementing the Counter Class
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are now ready to implement the Counter Class. Looks something
      like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
begin
  Result := Finput * 2;;
  Finput := Result;;
end;
 
function TCounter.: real;
var i: integer;
begin
  if Finput &lt; 0 thenn
          .Create('Cannot Factorial a negative number');
  Result := 1;;
  for i := 1 to trunc( Finput ) doo
    Result := Result * i; i;
  Finput := Result;;
end;
 
function TCounter.: real;
begin
  Result := Finput * Finput;;
  Finput := Result;;
end;
 
procedure TCounter.(const Value: real);
begin
  Finput := Value;;
end;
 
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      We can then run DUnit again, and expect all the tests to pass.
    </p>
    <h2>
      DUnit in production
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eventually the list of tests would be extremely long, covering
      all aspects of the code we have written. Daily test runs will be
      run in batch mode and any problems can be easily detected and
      fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please use DUnit extensively and update the test cases whenever
      you detect a new bug, think of a strange scenario or want peace
      of mind.

      DUnit Tutorial
    </p>
    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial will cover the creation of a new object with
      specific attributes and functions. Before the implementation of
      this object, a test harness is written to confirm that the object
      works. Using this harness we can also attempt to break this
      object, refactor and confirm that the objects works just as
      before, if not better.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Specifications
    </h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this Tutorial is to create an object called <b>
      TNumList</b>&nbsp; which can do these things:
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;collect an array of reals (maximum is 200 numbers)
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Add another real at the end of the list
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;keep a Count / Tally of the number of Reals
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Total Up the array of Reals
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Find the Average of the Reals
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Inherites directly from TObject
    </p>

      We will have to create a skeleton class with the necessary

    <p>
      Now lets set up the Test Harness Unit. Follow the instructions in
      the section &ldquo;Making a new Unit Test&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your code should look like this:
    </p>
    <div>
<pre> 
 
interface
uses
   ;
 
type
 
  TNumListTest = class(()
  protectedd

    <h2>
      Writing the Test Harness
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have set up your 3 files, you are ready to create
      the tests prior to implementation. This ensures that you have
      understood all the requirements and you know what to expect given
      the pre-conditions and inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define a protected variable called <b>mNumList</b> of type <b>
      TNumList</b>. Make sure that your SetUp procedure creates this
      object and your TearDown frees it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 1 &ndash; implementing testAdd
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing we would like to test is the Add procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is our test plan for Add:
    </p>
    <p>
      1.Make sure the NumList has zero Count
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Add a number like 321 in it
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Check that the Count has increased by one (no more no less)
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Add the next number 456
    </p>
    <p>
      5.Check that the Count has increased again
    </p>
    <p>
      6.Check using Nums that Nums[0] is equal to 321
    </p>
    <p>
      7.Check that Nums[1] is 456
    </p>
    <p>
      That should be enough to test the functionality of Add.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to assume that Count, SetNum and GetNum already work for
      the simple cases. However for more extensive tests, we need
      testGetNum and testSetNum
    </p>
    <p>
      Please create a new published procedure in TNumListTest and
      implement this test plan.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 2 &ndash; implementing testGetNum
    </h3>
    <p>
      Make sure that mNumList.Nums[2] works as planned. Make a test
      plan and implement it. It may be quite simple.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 3 &ndash; implementing testSetNum
    </h3>
    <p>
      Make sure that mNumList.Nums[2] := 343, works as planned. Make a
      test plan and implement it. It may be quite simple too.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 4 &ndash; implementing testTotal
    </h3>
    <p>
      Come up with your own test plan for testTotal, and implement it
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 5 &ndash; implementing testAverage
    </h3>
    <p>
      Come up with your own test plan for testAverage, and implement it
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Running the test Harness
    </h3>
    <p>
      Using the path of 'Tutorial/NumList', register your TestCase. See
      the section &ldquo;Registering TTestCase&rdquo; on how to do
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have created 3 tests you can try running this
      application by pressing F9. Click on the green Run button, and
      you should see something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br clear="ALL" />
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Running this, the DUnit interface reports errors in All of our 3
      test. This is as expected because we haven't implemented the
      TNumList object yet!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 6 &ndash; Implementation of the TNumList
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now you can proceed in implementing this simple object. After
      every step, run the DUnit interface to run through the tests for
      instant gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.Implement Add, which increments Count after adding onto the
      list
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Implement Total which totals up all the reals up to Count-1
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Implement Average which is the totals divided by Count
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 7 &ndash; testSetNum and its implementation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Make a test procedure to test the ability of <b>
      mNumList.Nums[0]</b> to be altered
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 8 &ndash; Further Testing
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will now proceed with further testing, and this normally
      called
    </p>
    <h4>
      Breaking the object!
    </h4>
    <p>
      &bull;What happens when we Access (Get) Nums[-1] or Nums[202] or
      even Nums[Count]?
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;What happens when we write (Set) Nums[-1] or Nums[202] or
      Nums[Count]?
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;What happens when we add more than 200 items in the list?
      <i>(Please turn on Project/Options/Compiler/Range Checking +
      Overflow)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;What happens when we try to get the Average without any
      items in the list?
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;What happens when we put very large reals in the list and
      find the Total? Use MaxDouble from Math
    </p>
    <h3>
      Decide on how to handle problems
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will now need to decide how to handle these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.If this object is accessed (either Get or Set) outside its
      Bounds, i.e. Nums[-1] or Nums[Count] then an exception called
      ENumListIndexOutOfBounds should be raised
    </p>
    <p>
      2.If we attempt to add more than 200 items, then an exception
      called ENumListCapacityExceeded should be raised
    </p>
    <p>
      3.If we try to get the Average from an empty list, then the
      result should be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.If the total is too large for the type an exception called
      ENumListTotalOverflow should be raised.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Write the new tests
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have decided on the peculiar situations, write out
      the tests to re-create this with the proper exception handling if
      necessary.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Fix the object
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the test harness has been completed, run DUnit and expect
      failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go back to the object and build in the necessary new behaviours
      of the object.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Refactoring and modifications
    </h2>
    <p>
      eXtreme Programming is about change. Customers tend to change
      their minds during the progress of a project. We should not
      encourage their changes, but we must be prepared that changes do
      occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the new requirement are:
    </p>
    <p>
      1.From the previous requirement of only 200 reals to be kept, we
      now need to keep track of an Unlimited (as much as RAM can
      handle) number of items
    </p>
    <p>
      2.There should be a method to delete any real given an index
    </p>
    <p>
      3.These numbers should be able to be sorted by Values
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 9 &ndash; Changing an Array to a TStringList
    </h3>
    <p>
      Given the 3 new requirements, we should consider changing our
      static Array FNums into a more dynamic TList descendant which can
      cater for Unlimited entries, sort functions and Deletes. The most
      user friendly one which comes to mind is a TStringList.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only drawback is that we will have to convert reals to
      Strings, which may hinder performance slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lets go along with that idea anyway, and proceed with this
      plan in REFACTORING our array into a TStringList.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      After we have done so, please run the DUnit checks to make sure
      that all the test cases work. If it does, congratulations, you
      have improved your code yet kept the functionality the same. Isnt
      encapsulation wonderful?
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
      Exercise 10 &ndash; Creating more tests for the new functions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Please proceed in planning and implementing tests for <b>
      testDelete</b> and <b>testSort</b>
