This is a sample project demonstrating how to use Firebird 4.0 with Zeos on Android 64 Bits.

Getting started:
- Unpack the Firebird ARM64 files into the firebird folder.
- Grab icudt63l.dat, libicudata.so.63, libicui18n.so.63, libicuuc.so.63 from the Firebird 4.0 RC1 release and put them in the correct locations.
- Grab a firebird.msg file from another distribution because it isn't generated automatically.

The project was tested with Firebird 4.0. For other versions you might have to do some changes.
